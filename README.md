# StormLens

**From 2,000 alerts to 3 answers.**

Alert Correlation & Deduplication Engine — Team ZenVerse @ Synergy 2026 (HPE Problem Statement #10).

## The Problem

During a significant infrastructure incident, monitoring systems generate hundreds or thousands of alerts within minutes. Almost all of them are downstream symptoms of a single root cause. On-call engineers waste the most critical minutes of an incident scrolling through noise instead of fixing the actual failure.

## What StormLens Does

StormLens ingests a raw alert stream and, in real time:

1. **Correlates** — groups temporally and semantically related alerts into incident clusters
2. **Identifies root cause** — ranks the most likely root-cause alert within each cluster using topology, timing, and severity signals, with a confidence score
3. **Suppresses noise** — collapses derivative alerts out of the primary view (still available in drill-down)
4. **Summarizes** — generates a one-paragraph incident brief and recommended first action via LLM

The result: an on-call engineer sees **3 incident cards instead of 2,000 alerts**, each answering "what broke, how bad, what do I do first."

## The Demo

Side-by-side war room view:

- **Left panel**: the raw alert stream, flooding in real time (replayed from labeled datasets at accelerated speed)
- **Right panel**: StormLens's correlated view — a handful of incident cards, each with a root-cause alert, confidence score, blast radius, and LLM-generated summary

Measured on labeled ground truth (AIOps Challenge dataset): compression ratio, cluster accuracy, and root-cause hit rate. Numbers, not vibes.
